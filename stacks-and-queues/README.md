# Stacks and Queues

- Value: collection of objects.
- Operations: *Insert*, *Remove*, *Iterate*, Test *if empty*.
- Insertion intent is clear, but which item to be removed?
  - Stack: LIFO — Examine item most recently added.
  - Queue: FIFO — Examine item least recently added.

#### Linked List Implemetation: O(1)

#### Array Implemetation: O(1)
