# Data Structures and Algorithms


> *Great algorithms are the poetry of computation* â€” Francis Sullivan


This repo contains TypeScript implementations of the Algorithms and Data Structures taught in the Coursera MOOC [Algorithms, Part I and II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/), by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne of Princeton University. 


Currently a Work-in-Progress.
